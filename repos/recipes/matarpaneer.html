   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Matar Paneer is a popular Indian curry made with paneer which is Indian cottage cheese and green peas. It can be made in various ways and usually enjoyed with rotis, paratha and rice. The paneer and peas are cooked with aromatic spices and the curry usually has a base of onions and tomatoes.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Paneer</li>
    <li> Onion & tomatoes</li>
    <li>Green peas</li>
    <li>Spices
        <p>the basic Indian spices used in everyday Indian cooking like coriander powder, turmeric are used here as well. I also use a little bit of fennel powder.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li> Heat 1 & 1/2 tablespoon oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add 5-6 cashewnuts and sauté few seconds until they become light golden brown in color. Then add 2 small roughly chopped yellow onions (230 grams) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until it turns soft and very light brown in color. We don’t want it to turn very brown.</li>
    <li>Then add 2 teaspoons of ginger garlic paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
    <li> Add 3 medium tomatoes/385 grams (roughly sliced) , 1 green chili (or to taste) along with 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li> Stir and cook the tomatoes for 5 minutes until they are very soft. Remove the pan from heat and let it cool down.</li>
    <li> Then transfer to a blender and grind everything to a smooth paste and set aside.</li>
    <li> Heat 1 tablespoon ghee and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a pan on medium heat. Add 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then add 3/4 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder.</li>
    <li>Stir and immediately add the prepared masala paste. This will give the masala a nice color. Mix until masala is well combined with the chili powder.</li>
    <li> Then add the following
        <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fennel powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
    </ul>
        </li>
    <li>Stir and cook the masala for 6 to 7 minutes. When done, you will oil ooze out of the masala and the color of the masala will change from orange to reddish. It will also reduce in volume.</li>
    <li>At this point add 250 grams paneer and 3/4 cup green peas (frozen peas which I had soaked in warm water for 10 minutes before) and mix well.</li>
    <li> Then add 1 & 1/4 cup water and the remaining salt (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon or to taste). Stir everything and cover and let cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li> Garnish with 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon garam masala, and sprinkle of cardamom powder. You may also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cream at this point (I didn’t add any). Serve matar paneer hot with rotis or paratha.</li>
