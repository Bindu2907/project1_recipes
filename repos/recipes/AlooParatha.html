  <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Aloo means “potato” and paratha means “flatbread” in Hindi, so the name is quite telling: aloo paratha is an unleavened whole wheat flatbread stuffed with a savory, spiced, mashed potato filling.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li> wheat flour</li>
    <li>Mashed potato stuffing </li>
    <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
    <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
    <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
<li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>
<li>salt according to your taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For cooking in a pressure cooker – On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
    <li>For cooking in a pan – Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
    <li> If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.</li>
    <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
    <li> Now add the All ingredients mentioned above , feeling free to vary the spices as you like</li>
    <li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside</li>
    <li> In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.</li>
    <li> Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
    <li> Pinch two small balls from the dough. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>With a rolling pin, roll them into rounds roughly 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Try making both the discs the same size.</li>
    <li>. On one of the discs, place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 1 inch empty space from the sides</li>
    <li>Gently place the second circle on top.</li>
    <li> Press and seal the edges with your fingertips. If you are not able to seal the edges, then brush or spread some water on the edges and then seal</li>
    <li>. Dust some flour on the stuffed aloo ka paratha and start rolling.</li>
    <li> Roll the paratha into a round about 7 to 8 inches in diameter, or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.</li>
    <li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft.</li>
    <li>When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.</li>
    <li>Spread some ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part.</li>
    <li>Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting.</li>
    <li> Flip again once or twice till both sides are cooked properly, with crisp brown spots. You should also press the alu paratha edges down with a spatula or spoon so that they are fried well. Repeat, making all parathas this way</li>
</ol>
